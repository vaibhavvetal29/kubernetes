StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.

Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods.


StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.
1) Stable, unique network identifiers.
2) Stable, persistent storage.
3) Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
4) Ordered, automated rolling updates.

For a StatefulSet with n replicas, each Pod is assigned a unique integer ordinal between 0 and n â€“ 1. The names of the Pods reflect the integer identity assigned to them. When a StatefulSet is created, all the Pods are created in the order of their integer ordinal.
